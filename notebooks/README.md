| --- | --- | 
| [1: Digit classification](1_digit_classification.ipynb)<br>Deep learning 101: Classifying handwritten numbers. This notebook serves as a quick intro to the [Keras](keras.io) deep learning framework. | [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HVL-ML/DAT255/blob/main/notebooks/1_digit_classification.ipynb) |
| [2: _Fashion MNIST_ classification](2_fashion_MNIST_classification.ipynb)<br>In this notebook we go a little further in computer vision. | [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HVL-ML/DAT255/blob/main/notebooks/2_fashion_MNIST_classification.ipynb) |
| [3: Advanced image classification](3_advanced_image_classification.ipynb)<br> Time to do more advanced stuff, which requires a more powerful approach to constructing neural networks in Keras, namely the [functional model API](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/). Here we also start using TensorFlow datasets, image augmentation, and look at _fine-tuning_ of existing models. | [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HVL-ML/DAT255/blob/main/notebooks/3_advanced_image_classification.ipynb) |
