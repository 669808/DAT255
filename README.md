## Course description
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning and is what both launched and propels the recent surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The course focuses on deep learning and its applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. The methods, tools, and techniques covered by the course are widely applicable, and the course aims to be instructive to anyone wanting to apply deep learning to any task.

In addition to a solid understanding of deep learning, the course will provide you with hands-on experience designing and deploying deep learning solutions for practical, real-life problems using state-of-the-art techniques and software frameworks from machine learning, machine learning engineering, and deep learning. You will experience first-hand how deep learning engineering relates to the broader software engineering discipline.
